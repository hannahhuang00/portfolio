              <h3 class="h3">Overview</h3>
              <p>I completed this project for a mechatronics class I took during my Sophomore year (2021).
                In this project, I wired and programmed the NU32 PIC32 microcontroller to control the position of a motor. 
                The code stored on the microcontroller was programmed in C, which communicates with a MATLAB client. Through the MATLAB 
                client, the user inputs a trajectory of angles that will be tracked by the motor. The schematic of the process is shown below, 
                where there is an inner current (PI) controller and an outer position (PID) controller, with weights that can be adjusted by 
                the user through the client. This project was divided into hardware and software. See examples demonstrations of the motor 
                interacting with the MATLAB client below.
              </p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled list-line mb-5">
                As a team of entirely mechanical engineers, only four of us had experience with microcontrollers; however, none of us had very
                in-depth knowledge. Of the four, I had taken the most computer science and mechatronics classes, so I became responsible 
                for a lot of the programming and hardware. This included:
                <li>Retrofitting a regular bike with a mid-drive e-Bike conversion kit.</li>
                <li>Rewiring the motor controller to take input from our microcontroller.</li>
                <li>Sending sensor data to the IoT platform through MQTT protocols.</li>
                <li>Creating a React Native app (with user profiles), which communicated with the IoT through HTTP protocol and 
                  allowed the user to see their current assist level, heart rate, and power input.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="h3">Lessons Learned</h3>
              <p>This project forced me to learn a lot. I had never worked with IoT clients before, so I had to learn MQTT and HTTP protocols.
                I had also never made a React website, which was necessary for visualizing real-time data. The first motor controller we 
                purchased was entirely in Chinese, so it took me hours of trial and error to figure out how to "hack" into the system. We also
                did not have all the tools available for taking a bike apart, and had to get creative with making some tools ourselves.
