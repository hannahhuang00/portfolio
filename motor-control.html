              <p>I completed this project for a mechatronics class I took during my Sophomore year (2021).
                In this project, I wired and programmed the NU32 PIC32 microcontroller to control the position of a motor. 
                The code stored on the microcontroller was programmed in C, which communicates with a MATLAB client. Through the MATLAB 
                client, the user inputs a trajectory of angles that will be tracked by the motor. 
              </p>
              <p>The block diagram shows an inner current (PI) controller and an outer position (PID) controller, with weights that can be adjusted by 
                the user through the client. This project was divided into hardware and software. See examples demonstrations of the motor 
                interacting with the MATLAB client below.</p>

                <p>The microcontroller sends a 20 kHz PWM duty to the H-bridge, which sends the current 
                  to the motor. The H-bridge is a series of transistors that turn on and off depending on the amount of current flowing through it. 
                  These transistors change the amount and direction of current flowing through the motor, allowing the motor to change directions. 
                  This is not possible to be done through the microcontroller directly because the digital output pins only allow positive voltage 
                  and 0 voltage. The current that is sent from the H-bridge to the motor is put in series with the RS+ and RS- ends of the MAX9918 
                  to sense the current through the motor. Between the RS+ and RS- ends of the chip, there is an internal resistor. The MAX9918 
                  measures the voltage drop across these two ends, offsets the voltage by the REFIN voltage, then amplifies this voltage based on 
                  the gains set by the resistors at FB (amplification is done by an internal op-amp). This voltage is then read into an analog input 
                  into the microcontroller. I set my current-sensor gain to ~61, but this number did not really matter, as the current PID controller 
                  would rescale the signal again. The secondary microcontroller reads the position of the motor from the encoder, and this information 
                  is sent to the main NU32 microcontroller via SPI.

                  <p>The C code is organized into five main functions: encoder reading, current sensing, current control, position control, 
                    and utilities. The main.c code interfaces with the client and calls upon the functions stored in these files when needed. 
                    The encoder file owns an SPI (serial peripheral interface) peripheral and deals with reading the encoder count from the 
                    secondary microcontroller and converting this to an angle in degrees. The current sensing file owns the ADC 
                    (analog-to-digital converter) peripheral which reads the ADC counts from the current sensing block and converts it to 
                    milliamps. The utilities file keeps track of the “mode” of the microcontroller: IDLE, PWM, ITEST, HOLD, or TRACK. The 
                    position controller owns a timer to implement a 200 Hz control loop. It loads a trajectory as well as position gains 
                    from the client, which are used in a PID controller that sends a current trajectory to the current controller. The current 
                    control file holds the bulk of code because the output current of the microcontroller directly determines the behavior of 
                    the motor.
                  </p>
                  <p>The current control file owns two timers, an output compare, and one digital output. The first timer is used to implement 
                    a 5 kHz current control loop, while the output compare and second timer are used to send a 20 kHz PWM signal to the H-bridge 
                    through the digital output. In IDLE mode, the current controller sends no PWM and brakes the motor. In PWM mode, a PWM duty 
                    specified by the user is sent to the H-bridge. In ITEST mode, the current controller uses the controller gains set by the 
                    user to track a 100 Hz ±200 mA square reference wave. In HOLD or TRACK mode, the current controller tracks a trajectory given
                    by the position controller based on the gains specified by the user. The PI controller compares the sensed current with the 
                    reference current, determines an integral error, and uses the proportionality and integral gains to determine a new duty 
                    cycle. The code for the PI controller is shown.
