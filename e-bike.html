              <h3 class="h3">Overview</h3>
              <p>This project was completed in a team of 6 other students as a Senior Design Capstone project. 
                Our client, Altair, wanted us to create an e-Bike that adjusts assist level based on bio-metric feedback (such as heart 
                rate and user torque input). The bike was to send data to Altair's Internet of Things (IoT) application and display 
                real-time data to the user. The target group was older bikers, who want to workout, while decreasing their risk of injury
                from overexertion.
              </p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled list-line mb-5">
                As a team of entirely mechanical engineers, only four of us had experience with microcontrollers; however, none of us had very
                in-depth knowledge. Of the four, I had taken the most computer science and mechatronics classes, so I became responsible 
                for a lot of the programming and hardware. This included:
                <li>Retrofitting a regular bike with a mid-drive e-Bike conversion kit.</li>
                <li>Rewiring the motor controller to take input from our microcontroller.</li>
                <li>Sending sensor data to the IoT platform through MQTT protocols.</li>
                <li>Creating a React Native app (with user profiles), which communicated with the IoT through HTTP protocol and 
                  allowed the user to see their current assist level, heart rate, and power input.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3 class="h3">Lessons Learned</h3>
              <p>This project forced me to learn a lot. I had never worked with IoT clients before, so I had to learn MQTT and HTTP protocols.
                I had also never made a React website, which was necessary for visualizing real-time data. The first motor controller we 
                purchased was entirely in Chinese, so it took me hours of trial and error to figure out how to "hack" into the system. We also
                did not have all the tools available for taking a bike apart, and had to get creative with making some tools ourselves.
